# Calculator

Creating a calculator with JavaScript, CSS and HTML is a relatively simple and straightforward process. The first step is to write the HTML code for the calculator interface. This should include the buttons, input fields, and other elements that will make up the calculator.

Next, you'll need to write the CSS code to style the calculator. This includes setting the size and color of the buttons and making sure the calculator looks good on different devices.

Finally, you'll need to write the JavaScript code to make the calculator functional. This involves setting up event listeners to detect when the user clicks on a button, and writing functions to perform the appropriate calculations.
